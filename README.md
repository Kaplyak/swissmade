## About

I made Swissmade to expand and showcase my skills as a front end engineer.

I used **NextJS**, **React**, and **JavaScript** to build the full structure of this project, including *dynamic URLs* for every product and category.<br/>
To store product information, I created a **PostgreSQL** database and hosted it in **Heroku**.<br/>
To style this project, I used **Tailwind CSS** and a little bit of custom CSS. Making use of Talwind breakpoints, I made Swissmade **fully responsive**.<br/>
Finally, I deployed this project on **Vercel** to have an easy solution for Continuous Integration.
